    "final_prompt": "Haunter from Pok\u00e9mon is pictured as a silhouetted figure outlined with glowing neon energy, set against a dark background with purple haze. Haunter is reimagined with a sleek, metallic armor that covers its ghostly shape, featuring sharp edges and a futuristic visor for its eyes. Its hands are replaced with holographic projections of claws, emanating an eerie neon green glow. The armor is a dominant palette of deep purples and blacks, creating a cyberpunk aesthetic. Haunter is centered, with the neon outline radiating outward, occupying the majority of the frame to emphasize its presence. It faces forward, slightly turned to create a dynamic perspective. The image is in 2D silhouette with 3D effects from neon highlights and background haze, focusing on dynamic motion and mystery.
